# copycat-website-project

##Reflection
  Our SEP class had currently learned some of the most simple aspects of CSS, after learning HTML. In order to show what we have learned, this copycat-website proect was made to get more experienced in coding the front end of websites. I´m personally not very talented in coding, which is why I chose a simple design to recreate: google. Eventhough google leaned towards the mild deifficulty level of this project, it was still very difficult me in the aspect that I didn´t know how to center pieces of text, or buttons or boxes. Now I know that I could use the position CSS property to specify where exactly I want something on a screen. Eventhough, my recreation of the google website is´t exact, I still tried my very best to make it as identical as possible.
